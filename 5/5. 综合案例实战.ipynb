DataFrame.merge：类似 vlookup\n","        - merge(left, right, how='inner', on=None, left_on=None, right_on=None, left_index=False, right_index=False, sort=True, suffixes=('_x', '_y'), copy=True, indicator=False) \n","        - 类似于关系型数据库的连接方式，可以根据一个或多个键将不同的DatFrame连接起来。该函数的典型应用场景是，针对同一个主键存在两张不同字段的表，根据主键整合到一张表里面。\n","    - 3. DataFrame.join：主要用于索引上的合并\n","        - join(self, other, on=None, how='left', lsuffix='', rsuffix='',sort=False): \n","        - 其参数的意义与merge方法中的参数意义基本一样。该方法最为简单，主要用于索引上的合并。\n","    - 4. 其参数的意义与merge方法中的参数意义基本一样。该方法最为简单，主要用于索引上的合并。\n","        - Series.append(self, to_append, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False) \n","    - 5.
